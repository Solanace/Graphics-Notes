## 05/16: Animation
* Goal: Generate multiple images in a sequence with small changes between each
* Apply transformations over time
* `move 400 0 0 <modifier in the domain [0, 1]>` - requires too much repetition

#### Knobs
* In MDL, this modifier is called a **knob** (modifies move, rotate, and translate)
* If there's no knob, the code just does the entire transformation
* If there is a knob, look up its value and modify args by it
* `move x y z [knob]` - Command format
* `move 400 0 0 m0` - m0 is a variable name
* M0 needs to convey the number of frames, as well as the location we are moving to and from

#### New Commands
* Vary:
	* `vary <knob> <start frame> <end frame> <start value> <end value>`
	* `vary m0 0 4 0 1`
	* Computes and stores the knob values for each frame
* Frames:
	* `frames <total # of frames>`
	* `frames 5`
	* Have a variable that stores the total number of frames in the animation
* Basename:
	* `basename <name>`
	* `basename rolling`
	* Sets the name of the animation .png/.gif files
	* Have a variable that stores this name

#### Generating Animated Files
* We must save animations in .gif files, not .png
* Make sure to store the .png files in a separate directory and DO NOT PUSH THEM TO GITHUB
* Call `animate file`, not `display file`
* Default framefrate is 100 FPS
* Framerate can be altered like so: `convert -delay 10 anim/rollin.gif`
* The `-delay N` flag creates a N/100 secon delay between frames

#### 3-Pass Animation Framework
1. Setup
	* Set frames if frames command is present
	* Set basename is basename command is present
	* Stop if vary is present but not frames
	* **Stop if more frames are specified than actually used (see below)**
2. Vary
	* Compute and stores all knob values for every frame
	* Stop if vary range is invalid
3. Draw
	* Repeat loop for each frame
	* Update knobs in symbol table at the start of each loop
	* Save the current frame at the end of each loop

#### Structure for Storing Knob Values
* Have an array of frames, where each frame has its associated knob values stored with it

```
vary m0 0  3  0 .5
vary m0 4  6 .5 .8
vary m0 9 11 .8  1
```
* Frames 7 and 8 are absent - what happens? What are their values?
* Screw that, throw a compiler error! Why should you have to deal with this?!

---

## 05/07: Compilers
* Our parser should be able to parse variables, do looping, etc.
* Sample script:
```
shiny_blue = 0 0 0.1 0 0 0.3 0 0 0.8
box
0 0 0 10 20 30 shiny_blue
```
* We want a compiler that takes source code and turns it into an image (or images)
* We're used to compilers that take source code and turn it into executable code
	* These compilers have several components:
	* lexer -> syntactic analyzer -> semantic analyzer -> optimizer (optional) -> code generator

| Name              | Input                 | Output                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| lexer             | source code           | token list                   |
| parser            | token list            | syntax tree                  |
| semantic analyzer | syntax tree           | operation list, symbol table |
| optimizer         | operation list        | optimized operation list     |
| code generator    | OO-list, symbol table | binary executable            |

#### Lexer
* Performs lexical analysis
* "Knows" all valid tokens in a language, including string literals, numeric literals, operators, formatting characters, keywords, and identifiers (function names, variables)
* Reads in source code and outputs a token list, doesn't catch invalid identifiers (e.g., undefined variable names)
* Example:
```C
int main() {
	long x = 5 + 6;
	printf("%d", x);
	return x;
}
```
* Token list: int, main, (, ), {, \n, \t, long, x, =, 5, +, 6, ;, printf, (, "%d", x, ), ;, ...
* C lexers: Lex, flex; Java lexers: JavaCC
* We might be doing regex?

#### Parser
* Performs syntax analysis
* Checks the token list against the defined structure (i.e., grammar) of the language
* Output is a syntax tree that can and does reorder the token list:
```
	       int main
       ____________|_____________
       =         printf      return
_______|___   _____|___        _|_
long x    +   "%d"    x         x
       ___|___
       5     6
```
* Tools: yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler), bison

#### Semantic Analyzer
* Evaluates the syntax tree and creates an operation list and symbol table (stores identifiers and associated information)
* If the languaged is typed, type-checking will occur here
* Does NOT evaluate expressions
* Tree traversal types:
	* post: L -> R -> M
	* pre: M -> L -> R
	* in: L -> M -> R

**Operation List**

| Number | Operation | Arguments |
| ------ | --------- | --------- |
| 0      | +         | 5, 6      |
| 1      | =         | x, \[0]   |
| 2      | return    | x         |

**Symbol Table**

| Symbol | Category | Type? |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| main   | function | int   |
| x      | value    | long  |
| printf | function | int   |

#### Optimizer
* Optimizes operation list

#### Code Generator
* Translates the operation list into binary assembly code

#### Our Code
```
image script -> token list -> syntax tree ->  -> operation list + symbol table --code generator-->  image(s)
```

## 04/26: Lighting
* Colors are modeled based on:
	1. Color, intensity, and location of light
	2. Reflective properties of the object(s)

#### Types of light sources
* Ambient light
	* General background lighting
	* No particular source (comes from everywhere)
	* Represented by a 0-255 color value
* Point light
	* Comes from a specific location
	* Can have many sources for an image
	* Assumed to be very far away so it lights all objects simlarly (parallel rays)
	* Represented by a color and location

#### Phong Reflection Model
* Models real world reflections by breaking them into 3 parts - ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection
* I (illumination, color value) = Ambient + Diffuse + Specular = A * K<sub>a</sub> + P * K<sub>d</sub> * (N̂ • L̂) + P * K<sub>s</sub> * \[(2(N̂ • L̂)N̂ - L̂) • V̂]<sup>x</sup>
* If I > 255, set I = 255 (pure white, brightest we can do)
* Ambient is self-explanatory, diffuse and specular are based off point sources
* Ambient = A * K<sub>a</sub>
	* A: Color of ambient light (0-255 RGB)
	* K<sub>a</sub>: Constant of ambient reflection (0-1)
* Diffuse = P * K<sub>d</sub> * (N̂ • L̂)
	* Light comes from a single source and is reflected back in all directions, models dull and matte surfaces
	* P: Color of point/light source
	* K<sub>d</sub>: Constant of diffuse reflection
	* N̂ • L̂ = cos(θ)
		* N̂: Normalized normal vector
		* L̂: Normalized light vector _from_ the surface _to_ the light source (easier math)
		* θ: Angle between N̂ and L̂
		* If N̂ • L̂ <= 0, the surface is not illuminated by the point source so Diffuse = 0
* Specular = P * K<sub>s</sub> * \[(2(N̂ • L̂)N̂ - L̂) • V̂]<sup>x</sup>
	* Reflects a point light source in a specific direction, models glossy/shiny surfaces
	* P: Color of point/light source
	* K<sub>s</sub>: Constant of specular reflection
	* N̂: Normalized normal vector
	* L̂: Normalized light vector _from_ the surface _to_ the light source (easier math)
	* θ: Angle of incidence, cos(θ) = N̂ • L̂
	* T⃗: Vertical component of L̂ = (N̂ • L̂)N̂
	* S⃗: Horizontal component of L̂
	* R̂: Normalized reflection vector (also from the surface) = 2T⃗ - L̂ = 2(N̂ • L̂)N̂ - L̂
	* V̂: Normalized view vector
	* α: Angle between R̂ and V̂, cos(α) = R̂ • V̂ = (2(N̂ • L̂)N̂ - L̂) • V̂
	* Specular reflection dies off really quickly, like an exponential, which is represented by x (something like 16)

## 04/17: Colors
#### Scanline Conversion
* Filling in a polygon by drawing consecutive horizontal or vertical lines
* Order vertices vertically for bottom, middle, and top (B, M, and T)
* Need to find the endpoints of each scanline
* y: y<sub>B</sub> -> y<sub>T</sub>, step = 1
* x<sub>0</sub>: x<sub>B</sub> -> x<sub>T</sub>,
step = Δ0 = 1 / m =
(x<sub>T</sub> - x<sub>B</sub>) / (y<sub>T</sub> - y<sub>B</sub>) =
Δx / # of scanlines
* x<sub>1</sub> is more complicated
	* On BM until y = y<sub>M</sub>, then on MT
	* Step = Δ1 =
	(x<sub>M</sub> - x<sub>B</sub>) / (y<sub>M</sub> - y<sub>B</sub>) or
	(x<sub>T</sub> - x<sub>M</sub>) / (y<sub>T</sub> - y<sub>M</sub>)
	* Tip: when y = y<sub>M</sub>, set x = x<sub>M</sub>
* Special case where two points have the same y-value - arbitrarily define one to be the top/bottom and the other to be the middle
* We will deal with rendering the correct objects in the front eventually - for now, test something simpler like a sphere, not Mr. Roboto

#### Z-Buffer
* 2D array of floating-point values, 1:1 mapping with the screen's array
* Check the z-buffer before updating the screen
* Initialize each z value to be the smallest possible (most negative) value
* A lot of functions receive insignificant changes, mostly adding the z-buffer as an argument to be passed on
* `plot()` must check/modify the z-buffer
* `draw_line()` must compute z-values
* `scanline_convert()` must compute z-values

## 04/11: Relative Coordinate System
* Currently, transformations are applied to all shapes in the polygon/edge matrix
* A relative coordinate system applies transformations to THE WORLD
* This lets us draw each shape in a different world
```
[1 0 0 0]  [2 0 0  50]
[0 1 0 0]  [0 2 0 100]
[0 0 1 0]  [0 0 2   0]
[0 0 0 1]  [0 0 0   1]
```
* Matrix A does nothing because it's an identity matrix
* Matrix B doubles everything and translates it
* If we apply matrix B to the world, the origin will become (50, 100, 0) and everything will be scaled to 2x for drawing _new_ objects

#### Drawing in an RCS
1. Generate polygons/edges (currently all we do)
2. Immediately apply the current coordinate system to those points
3. Draw the polygons/edges to the image

#### Downsides
* Difficult to make complicated objects of many parts (e.g., a robot that consists of a spherical head, box body will have trouble moving while turning its head)
* We need to keep track of multiple coordinate systems, some sort of data structure
* We're not using trees, but a tree diagram is visually helpful:
```
MISTER    ROBOTO
     Global
       |
     Torso
    /  |  \
Head Upper \
      Arm   Leg
       |
     Lower
      Arm
```
* We're using stacks: simple and efficient (LIFO)

#### Coordinate System Stack
* Goal: maintain a stack of coordinate systems
* Top will be the current coordinate system
* Bottom will always be the identity matrix
* Transformations will modify top coordinate system
* Multiply the top by the transformation matrix
* Say we're drawing just the head and torso, with the head rotated 90 degrees:
```
Command | Stack
===================
push    | I
        | I
-------------------
move    | I•M1
        | I
-------------------
box     |
-------------------
push    | I•M1
        | I•M1
        | I
-------------------
move    | I•M1•M2
        | I•M1
        | I
-------------------
rotate  | I•M1•M2•R
        | I•M1
        | I
-------------------
sphere  |
```

## 03/20: Vectors

* A vector is a unit with both direction and magnitude (displayed as A&#8407;)
* <x, y, z>, arrow drawn from the origin

![alt text](https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/vector_2d_coordinates.png)

* Magnitude - ||A⃗|| = sqrt(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>)
* Normalized vector - unit vector that preserves the direction of another vector
	* Â = 1 / ||A⃗|| * (A<sub>x</sub>, A<sub>y</sub>, A<sub>z</sub>)
* Dot product - A⃗ • B⃗ = ||A⃗|| ||B⃗|| cos(θ) =
A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> +
A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>y</sub> +
A<sub>z</sub>B<sub>z</sub>
* Cross product - perpendicular to A and B, magnitude = area of parallelogram
	* A⃗ x B⃗ = ||A⃗|| ||B⃗|| sin(θ) =
	(A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>z</sub> - A<sub>z</sub>B<sub>y</sub>)î +
	(A<sub>z</sub>B<sub>x</sub> - A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>z</sub>)ĵ +
	(A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub> - A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>x</sub>)k̂
	* Use newlines for good formatting in your code
* Remember that the dot product is a scalar and the cross product is a vector that needs 3 dimensions!

#### Wireframe Mesh
* Shape is defined by the edges that connect points on the surface
* `add_box()` calls `add_edge()` calls `add_point()`
* `draw_lines()` calls `draw_line()`
* Very limited, because no surfaces (no shading, no coloring in, can't tell which object is in front)

#### Polygon Mesh
* Shape is defined by the polygons that connect points on the surface (triangles)
* Points of a triangle:
	* Edge matrix: \[P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>0</sub>]
	* Polygon matrix: \[P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>]
* `add_box()` calls **`add_polygon()`** calls `add_point()`
* **`draw_polygons()`** calls **`draw_polygon()`**
* Points must be added in a counterclockwise manner for the cross product's RHR

#### Backspace Culling
* Only drawing the polygons that are forward-facing
* Both easier on the eyes and the computer
* N⃗ - Surface normal, vector perpendicular to the polygon surface
* V⃗ - View vector drawn from the surface to the eye/camera
* When the angle between N⃗ and V⃗ >= 90°, the surface is no longer visible
* 3-step process:
	1. Calculate N⃗
		* A⃗ = <P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>>
		* B⃗ = <P<sub>2</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>>
		* N⃗ = A⃗ x B⃗ = <x, y, z>
	2. Find θ
		* V⃗ = k̂ = <0, 0, 1>
		* N⃗ • V⃗ = ||N⃗|| ||V⃗|| cos(θ) = 0 + 0 + z
	3. If -90° < θ < 90°, draw
		* cos(θ) > 0
		* Therefore, just see if the z-component of N⃗ is positive

## 03/13: 3D Shapes

#### Box
* Defining points are vertices
* Given any single vertex (top-left-front), width (x), height (y), and depth (z)
```
add_box(pt, x, y, z) {
	add_edge(pt, pt + x)
	Do this another 11 times for the other 11 lines
	Amazing
}
```

#### Sphere
* Defining points are on the surface
* Given center and radius
* Generate points by drawing and rotating a circle about the x-axis (horizontal poles) or y-axis (vertical poles)
* X-axis rotation matrix:
```
[1     0     0][rcosθ]
[0  cosϕ -sinϕ][rsinθ]
[0  sinϕ  cosϕ][    0]
```
* x = rcosθ + cx
* y = rsinθcosϕ + cy
* z = rsinθsinϕ + cz
* θ = angle of circle creation, ϕ = angle of circle rotation
* A circle only needs to be rotated halfway before creating a sphere
* Can also do it the other way, completely rotating a semicircle
	* We're doing it this way (makes stuff easier to calculate later on)
* Pseudocode:
```
for (ϕ: 0 -> 2π) {
	for (θ: 0 -> π) { // Semicircle
		x = rcosθ + cx
		y = rsinθcosϕ + cy
		z = rsinθsinϕ + cz
	}
}
```

#### Torus
* Defining points are on the surface
* Given center, radius of tube (r), distance from center to center of tube (R)
* Generate points by drawing and rotating a circle, but unlike a sphere, it's not centered at the origin
	* If we move over x, rotate about y and vice versa
```
[ cosϕ  0  sinϕ][rcosθ + R]
[    0  1     0][    rsinθ]
[-sinϕ  0  cosϕ][        0]
```
* x = cosϕ(rcosθ + R) + cx
* y = rsinθ + cy
* z = -sinϕ(rcosθ + R) + cz

## 03/07: Bezier Curves

The 'r' is silent!

* Can apply to a polynomial of any degree, though we're only doing cubics.
* A polynomial of degree n is defined by n + 1 points.

	* b = 3P<sub>0</sub> - 6P<sub>1</sub> + 3P<sub>2</sub>
	* c = -3P<sub>0</sub> + 3P<sub>1</sub>

## 03/06: Hermite Curves

Given information:
* P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub> - Endpoints
* R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1</sub> - Rates of change at each endpoint
* f(t) = at<sup>3</sup> + bt<sup>2</sup> + ct + d
* f'(t) = 3at<sup>2</sup> + 2bt + c
* f(0) = d = P<sub>0</sub>
* f'(0) = c = R<sub>0</sub>
* f(1) = a + b + c + d = P<sub>1</sub>
* f'(1) = 3a + 2b + 1c = R<sub>1</sub>

This is a system of equations. Let's solve this using a matrix!
```
[0 0 0 1][a]   [P0]
[1 1 1 1][b]   [P1]
[0 0 1 0][c] = [R0]
[3 2 1 0][d]   [R1]
```
Because H • C (coefficients) = G (givens), H<sup>-1</sup> • G = C:
```
[ 2 -2  1  1][P0]   [a]
[-3  3 -2 -1][P1]   [b]
[ 0  0  1  0][R0] = [c]
[ 1  0  0  0][R1]   [d]
```

## 03/05: Parametric Equations
  
* Define a curve as a system of equations based on an independent variable (t).
* x = f(t)
* y = g(t)
* z = h(t)
* Restrict t between 0 and 1, sorta like a percentage.

#### General Parametric Framework (Pseudocode)

```
for (0 <= t <= 1, t += step) {
	x = f(t)
	y = g(t)
	add_edge(x, y)
}
```
* Line - (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) -> (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)
	* f(t) = x<sub>0</sub> + t(Δx)
	* g(t) = y<sub>0</sub> + t(Δy)
* Circle - (x<sub>c</sub>, y<sub>c</sub>) r
	* f(t) = rcos(2πt) + x<sub>c</sub>
	* g(t) = rsin(2πt) + y<sub>c</sub>
	* 0 <= θ <= 2π
* Consider making the loop an integer. For example, have t range from 0 to 100, and simply divide it by 100 for calculation purposes.
* We want to draw **splines**, or curves that can be combined smoothly. Only cubics will be drawn.

## 02/26: Transformations

**Remember to use the `clear_screen()` function when initializing a screen!**

#### Dilation
* Making an image bigger or smaller.
* (x, y, z) ---D<sub>(a, b, c)</sub>---> (ax, by, cz)
* Dilation matrix:
```
[a 0 0 0][x]   [ax]
[0 b 0 0][y]   [by]
[0 0 c 0][z] = [cz]
[0 0 0 1][1]   [ 1]
```
* If you want to make an image bigger/smaller without also moving one of its corners, translate it to the origin, dilate it, and translate it back again.

#### Rotation
* Z-Axis
	* Set aside the z-axis for now.
	* (x, y) ---R<sub>θ</sub>---> (?, ?)
	* Use polar coordinates!
	* x = rcos(ϕ)
	* x<sub>1</sub> = rcos(ϕ + θ) = rcos(ϕ)cos(θ) - rsin(ϕ)sin(θ) = xcos(θ) - ysin(θ)
	* y = rsin(ϕ)
	* y<sub>1</sub> = rsin(ϕ + θ) = rsin(ϕ)cos(θ) + rcos(ϕ)sin(θ) = ycos(θ) + xsin(θ)
	* (x, y) ---R<sub>θ</sub>---> (xcos(θ) - ysin(θ), ycos(θ) + xsin(θ))
	* z is unchanged!
	* Rotation matrix:
	```
	[cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 0][x]   [xcos(θ) - ysin(θ)]
	[sin(θ)  cos(θ) 0 0][y]   [ycos(θ) + xsin(θ)]
	[0           0  1 0][z] = [                z]
	[0           0  0 1][1]   [                1]
	```
* X-Axis
	* Rotation about the x-axis is pretty much the same thing as with the z-axis. Just swap x with y and y with z.
	* y = rcos(ϕ)
	* y<sub>1</sub> = rcos(ϕ + θ) = rcos(ϕ)cos(θ) - rsin(ϕ)sin(θ) = ycos(θ) - zsin(θ)
	* z = rsin(ϕ)
	* z<sub>1</sub> = rsin(ϕ + θ) = rsin(ϕ)cos(θ) + rcos(ϕ)sin(θ) = zcos(θ) + ysin(θ)
* Y-Axis
	* And again for the y-axis, swapping x with z and y with x:
	* z = rcos(ϕ)
	* z<sub>1</sub> = rcos(ϕ + θ) = rcos(ϕ)cos(θ) - rsin(ϕ)sin(θ) = zcos(θ) - xsin(θ)
	* x = rsin(ϕ)
	* x<sub>1</sub> = rsin(ϕ + θ) = rsin(ϕ)cos(θ) + rcos(ϕ)sin(θ) = xcos(θ) + zsin(θ)

#### Combining Transformations
Given the following matrices:
* E<sub>0</sub> - Edges
* T - Translate
* R - Rotate
* S - Scale

T • E<sub>0</sub> = E<sub>1</sub>  
R • E<sub>1</sub> = E<sub>2</sub>  
S • E<sub>2</sub> = E<sub>3</sub>  
E<sub>3</sub> = (S • R • T) • E<sub>0</sub>  
**THIS IS RIGHT-TO-LEFT!**

## 02/12: Representing Image Data

The origin will always be on the bottom left, not the top left, in order to make it easier to visualize image transformations.

#### Triangle Shenanigans
* Triangles can be represented through a list of their 3 endpoints.
* **Edge list** - List of points in the image. Every 2 points determine a line.
	* \[P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub>] generates lines \[P<sub>0</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n-1</sub>P<sub>n</sub>].
		* P<sub>0</sub> = (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>). The edge list is actually a 2D array!
		* For 3D images, points will include z-coordinates, which will also show up for rotations and other transformations.
	* This does have a bit of repetition, but space is relatively cheap.

Imagine the edge list as a 4xN matrix.

#### Matrix Math for Graphics
* \# of columns in matrix M = # of rows in matrix N.
	* A x B • B x C = A x C
* Non-commutative - M • N isn't _always_ N • M. Sometimes it's not even possible to reverse M and N, given the previous restriction.
* Examples:
```
          [a]
[1 2 3] • [b] = [1a + 2b + 3c]
          [c]
  1x3     3x1        1x1

[1 2 3]   [a b]   [1a + 2c + 3e  1b + 2d + 3f]
[4 5 6] • [c d] = [4a + 5c + 6e  4b + 5d + 6f]
[7 8 9]   [e f]   [7a + 8c + 9e  7b + 8d + 9f]
  3x3      3x2                3x2
```
**You will have to write a procedure to do this.**
* Multiplicative Identity Matrix - M • I = M
	* I is a square matrix with a top left/bottom right diagonal of 1's, and 0's everywhere else:
	```
	[1 0][a]   [a]
	[0 1][b] = [b]
	```

#### Transformations
* Focus on translations, dilations, and rotations.
* These are also known as **affine transformations**, which preserve vertices and order.
* Let E = edge matrix, T = transformation matrix. Should we do E • T or T • E?
* T • E = 4x4 • 4xN = 4xN

#### Translations
* Goal: Define the T matrix to be multiplied with a point matrix to perform a translation.
* (x, y, z) ---T<sub>(a, b, c)</sub>---> (x + a, y + b, z + c)
* Use 4x4 matrices with a diagonal of 1's like an identity matrix.
* The rightmost side will also have a, b, and c in descending order.
* Multiply this matrix with the column matrix of a point + a 4th row with a value of 1.
* Translation matrix:
```
[1 0 0 a][x]   [x + a]
[0 1 0 b][y]   [y + b]
[0 0 1 c][z] = [z + c]
[0 0 0 1][1]   [    1]
```

## 02/05: Bresenham's Line Algorithm

* In CS, we need to approximate values of y into integers.
* We don't care about the grid lines, we care about the boxes!
* Each box is represented by a single pixel.
* Instead of quadrants, we use octants.

#### Bresenham's Line Algorithm
* Goal: find the pixels that best approximate a target line.
* Assume that:
	1. (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) -> (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) ϵ Z
	2. For lines in octant I, 0 < m < 1
	3. x<sub>0</sub> < x<sub>1</sub> (can just swap their values, but make sure you swap the y-values too!)
* Because of these assumptions, we can take any colored pixel and move either right or right and up, never just up (slope is restricted).
* But which of those two is it?
* Find the value of the line at x + 1, and evaluate whether it is above or below (x + 1, y + 0.5).
	* If above, color the upper pixel.
	* If below, color the lower pixel.
	* If on, arbitrarily pick and stick with one.

#### Testing the Midpoint
* Midpoint = (x + 1, y + 0.5)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 1, y<sub>0</sub> + 0.5) = 2A + B
```
y = mx + b
0 = mx - y + b

m = Δy / Δx

0 = (Δy / Δx)x - y + b
  = xΔy -yΔx + bΔx
  = Ax + By + C
A = Δy
B = -Δx
C = bΔx

f(x,y) = Ax + By + C
d = f(x0 + 1, y0 + 0.5)
d = A + 0.5B
2d = 2A + B (we don't like decimals)
```
* Notice that B is negative; adding B reduces the value of B.
* When the midpoint is directly on the line, f(x, y) = 0 (this is not really that important).
* When the midpoint is above the line, f(x, y) < 0.
* When the midpoint is below the line, f(x, y) > 0.

#### Algorithm for Octant I
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A + B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d > 0
		y ++
		d += 2B
	x ++
	d += 2A
```

#### Algorithm for Octant II
* Midpoint = (x + 0.5, y + 1)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 0.5, y<sub>0</sub> + 1) = A + 2B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = A + 2B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		x ++
		d += 2A
	y ++
	d += 2B
```

#### Algorithm for Octant VIII
* Midpoint = (x + 1, y - 0.5)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 1, y<sub>0</sub> - 0.5) = 2A - B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A - B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		y --
		d -= 2B
	x ++
	d += 2A
```

#### Algorithm for Octant VII
* Midpoint = (x + 0.5, y - 1)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 0.5, y<sub>0</sub> - 1) = A - 2B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A - B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		x ++
		d += 2A
	y --
	d -= 2B
```

For Octants III, IV, V, and VI, just reverse the x-y coordinates and use the algorithms from Octants VII, VIII, I, and II respectively.

## 01/31: Peering into the Depths of Color

**Color Depth** - Amount of data used to represent a single pixel.

| Size   | Color Options                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1 bit  | 1 color, on \| off                      |
| 2 bit  | 1 color, on \| off, 1 bit for intensity |
| 3 bit  | RGB, on \| off                          |
| 4 bit  | RGB with intensity                      |
| 6 bit  | RGB, _each_ color has its own intensity |
| 3 byte | RGB, each with 256 possible intensities |

#### Other Color Spaces
* RGBA - Red, Green, Blue + Alpha (transparency)
* HSB - Hue, Saturation, Brightness

#### Image File Formats
* Raster vs. Vector
	* Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions and are infinitely scalable.
		* SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics
	* Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels.
* Uncompressed vs. Compressed (Raster)
	* Uncompressed formats contain data for each pixel.
		* Examples include BMP, TIFF, and RAW files.
	* Compressed formats use a compression algorithm to minimize file size.
	* Lossless vs. Lossy
		* Lossless compression algorithms contain enough information to exactly recreate the original image.
		* Lossless algorithms include PNG and GIF.
		* Lossy compression algorithms don't retain all the details of the original image.
		* The most commonplace lossy algorithm is JPEG.

#### PPM (Portable PixMap)
* Uncompressed raster format.
* Pixel data is represented by RGB triplets in either ASCII or binary.
* All whitespace is equivalent.
* Example:
```
P3 (file type, P3 is ASCII and P6 is binary)
4 3 (x-y dimensions)
255 (maximum value)
255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0
0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0
0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255
```
### Use the terminal command `convert file.ppm file.png` to compress your work!
