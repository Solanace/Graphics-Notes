## 02/12: Representing Image Data

Origins will always be on the bottom left, not the top left, in order to make it easier to visualize image transformations.

#### Triangle Shenanigans
* Triangles can be represented through a list of their 3 endpoints.
* **Edge list** - List of points in the image. Every 2 points determine a line.
	* \[P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub>] generates lines \[P<sub>0</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n-1</sub>P<sub>n</sub>].
		* P<sub>0</sub> = (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>). The edge list is actually a 2D array!
		* For 3D images, points will also include z-coordinates, but z-values also show up for rotations and other transformations.
	* This does have a bit of repetition, but space is relatively cheap.

## 02/07: Bresenham's Line Algorithm 3

#### Algorithm for Octant II
* Midpoint = (x + 0.5, y + 1)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 0.5, y<sub>0</sub> + 1) = A + 2B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = A + 2B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		x ++
		d += 2A
	y ++
	d += 2B
```

#### Algorithm for Octant VIII
* Midpoint = (x + 1, y - 0.5)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 1, y<sub>0</sub> - 0.5) = 2A - B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A - B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		y --
		d -= 2B
	x ++
	d += 2A
```

#### Algorithm for Octant VII
* Midpoint = (x + 0.5, y - 1)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 0.5, y<sub>0</sub> - 1) = A - 2B
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A - B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d < 0
		x ++
		d += 2A
	y --
	d -= 2B
```

For Octants III, IV, V, and VI, just reverse the x-y coordinates and use the algorithms from Octants VII, VIII, I, and II respectively.

## 02/06: Bresenham's Line Algorithm 2

#### Testing the Midpoint
* Midpoint = (x + 1, y + 0.5)
* d<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub> + 1, y<sub>0</sub> + 0.5) = 2A + B
```
y = mx + b
0 = mx - y + b

m = Δy / Δx

0 = (Δy / Δx)x - y + b
  = xΔy -yΔx + bΔx
  = Ax + By + C
A = Δy
B = -Δx
C = bΔx

f(x,y) = Ax + By + C
d = f(x0 + 1, y0 + 0.5)
d = A + 0.5B
2d = 2A + B (we don't like decimals)
```
* Notice that B is negative; adding B reduces the value of B.
* When the midpoint is directly on the line, f(x, y) = 0 (this is not really that important).
* When the midpoint is above the line, f(x, y) < 0.
* When the midpoint is below the line, f(x, y) > 0.

#### Algorithm for Octant I
```
x = x0, y = y0
d = 2A + B
while x <= x1
	plot(x, y)
	if d > 0
		y ++
		d += 2B
	x ++
	d += 2A
```

## 02/05: Bresenham's Line Algorithm 1

* In CS, we need to approximate values of y into integers.
* We don't care about the grid lines, we care about the boxes!
* Each box is represented by a single pixel.
* Instead of quadrants, we use octants.

#### Bresenham's Line Algorithm
* Goal: find the pixels that best approximate a target line.
* Assume that:
	1. (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) -> (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) ϵ Z
	2. For lines in octant I, 0 < m < 1
	3. x<sub>0</sub> < x<sub>1</sub> (can just swap their values, but make sure you swap the y-values too!)
* Because of these assumptions, we can take any colored pixel and move either right or right and up, never just up (slope is restricted).
* But which of those two is it?
* Find the value of the line at x + 1, and evaluate whether it is above or below (x + 1, y + 0.5).
	* If above, color the upper pixel.
	* If below, color the lower pixel.
	* If on, arbitrarily pick and stick with one.

## 01/31: Peering into the Depths of Color

**Color Depth** - Amount of data used to represent a single pixel.

| Size   | Color Options                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1 bit  | 1 color, on \| off                      |
| 2 bit  | 1 color, on \| off, 1 bit for intensity |
| 3 bit  | RGB, on \| off                          |
| 4 bit  | RGB with intensity                      |
| 6 bit  | RGB, _each_ color has its own intensity |
| 3 byte | RGB, each with 256 possible intensities |

#### Other Color Spaces
* RGBA - Red, Green, Blue + Alpha (transparency)
* HSB - Hue, Saturation, Brightness

#### Image File Formats
* Raster vs. Vector
	* Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions and are infinitely scalable.
		* SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics
	* Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels.
* Uncompressed vs. Compressed (Raster)
	* Uncompressed formats contain data for each pixel.
		* Examples include BMP, TIFF, and RAW files.
	* Compressed formats use a compression algorithm to minimize file size.
	* Lossless vs. Lossy
		* Lossless compression algorithms contain enough information to exactly recreate the original image.
		* Lossless algorithms include PNG and GIF.
		* Lossy compression algorithms don't retain all the details of the original image.
		* The most commonplace lossy algorithm is JPEG.

#### PPM (Portable PixMap)
* Uncompressed raster format.
* Pixel data is represented by RGB triplets in either ASCII or binary.
* All whitespace is equivalent.
* Example:
```
P3 (file type, P3 is ASCII and P6 is binary)
4 3 (x-y dimensions)
255 (maximum value)
255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0
0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0
0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255
```
### Use the terminal command `convert file.ppm file.png` to compress your work!
